Original example, STM32F103ZET6:

e-Paper 	STM32F103ZET6   Functionality           STM32F410 (my config)
Vcc 	    3.3V
GND 	    GND
DIN 	    PA7             SPI1_MOSI               PA7
CLK 	    PA5             SP1_SCK                 PA5 (used to be green led)
CS 	        PA3             Output (chip select)    PB6
DC 	        PA2             Output                  PC7
RST 	    PA1             Output                  PA9
BUSY 	    PA3             Input                   PA8



In order to make Waveshare libraries compile:
1. Fix all capitalization issues in the includes in User/Examples (or was it /e-Paper? one of those two)
2. Change all "stm32f1xx*.h" includes into stm32f4xx (or whatever your build target is)
3. Make sure to label the pins so that they match /User/Config/DEV_Config.h
4. Add All the User/ directories to include path in CMakeLists_template.txt:
     include_directories(Core/User/Config Core/User/e-Paper Core/User/Examples Core/User/Fonts Core/User/GUI)
    you don't need to put them into Core/, might be better to leave them in main folder
    by adding it to the template file, it gets put into CMakeLists.txt after every code generation

5. In order to get rid of implicit printf warnings:
    add "include <stdio.h>" to Config/Debug.h and Examples/EPD_Test.h (might be enough to do it in Debug.h)
